    <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <p>Hi, My name is Giancarlo Meza. I am currently a student at Pierce College and also apart of &lt;dev/Mission>. I am looking for an internship in the tech industry. My first job was at a sandwich shop, and within the time that i worked there I was never
      late. In the fast food industry, like the name says you have to be fast but also make sure that the product looks good, taste good and most importantly keep the customer happy. I have never got a complaint from my coworkers or customers. I am a
      very chill and happy person and have no problem getting along with others. I can also work independently. I am fluent in spanish and english. My goal is to graduate from &lt;dev/Mission>, transfer to a UCLA, finish getting my degree in CoSci, and
      pursue my career in the tech industry. I know I can be a great asset to the company because of my experience and skills. </div>
